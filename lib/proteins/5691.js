Involved in initial synthesis of DNA base J, JBP1 being able to [...] "},"2330906":{"id":2330906,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12530","name":"AAZ12530","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330907":{"id":2330907,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12531","name":"AAZ12531","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Ribosomal RNA processing protein 4"},"2330908":{"id":2330908,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12532","name":"AAZ12532","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330909":{"id":2330909,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12533","name":"AAZ12533","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330910":{"id":2330910,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12534","name":"AAZ12534","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330911":{"id":2330911,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12535","name":"AAZ12535","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330912":{"id":2330912,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12536","name":"AAZ12536","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330913":{"id":2330913,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12537","name":"AAZ12537","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"pumilio/PUF RNA binding protein 5, putative"},"2330914":{"id":2330914,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12538","name":"AAZ12538","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330915":{"id":2330915,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12539","name":"AAZ12539","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330916":{"id":2330916,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12540","name":"AAZ12540","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"2330917":{"id":2330917,"externalId":"5691.AAZ12541","name":"AAZ12541","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase; PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins.
