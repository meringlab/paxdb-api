regulating receptors of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family such as SLAMF1, CD244, LY9, CD84, SLAMF6 and SLAMF7. In SLAM signaling seems to cooperate with SH2D1B/EAT-2. Initially it has been proposed that association with SLAMF1 prevents SLAMF1 binding to inhibitory effectors including INPP5D/SHIP1 and PTPN11/SHP-2. However, by simultaneous interactions, recruits FYN which subsequently phosphorylates and activates SLAMF1. Positively regulates CD244/2B4- and CD84-mediated natural killer (NK) cell functions.

DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling"},"2029944":{"id":2029944,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019542","name":"ENTHD2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L691"},"2029945":{"id":2029945,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019543","name":"YIPF1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L692"},"2029946":{"id":2029946,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019544","name":"ENSSSCG00000023761","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L693"},"2029947":{"id":2029947,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019545","name":"TMEM223","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L694"},"2029948":{"id":2029948,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019546","name":"ENSSSCG00000028038","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L695"},"2029949":{"id":2029949,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019547","name":"ENSSSCG00000029527","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L696"},"2029950":{"id":2029950,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019548","name":"ENSSSCG00000027962","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein "},"2029951":{"id":2029951,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019550","name":"BCL2L11","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Bim alpha-1; Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"C1KGB6"},"2029952":{"id":2029952,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019553","name":"TSHZ3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6A2"},"2029953":{"id":2029953,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019555","name":"ENSSSCG00000022789","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6A4"},"2029954":{"id":2029954,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019556","name":"CHST2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6A5"},"2029955":{"id":2029955,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019557","name":"ENSSSCG00000028826","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6A6"},"2029956":{"id":2029956,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019558","name":"CSF1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 precursor ","uniprotId":"I3L6A7"},"2029957":{"id":2029957,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019560","name":"ENSSSCG00000026649","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6A9"},"2029958":{"id":2029958,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019561","name":"SLC6A6","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Transporter ","uniprotId":"I3L6B0"},"2029959":{"id":2029959,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019562","name":"ENSSSCG00000021132","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6B1"},"2029960":{"id":2029960,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019563","name":"ENSSSCG00000022718","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6B2"},"2029961":{"id":2029961,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019564","name":"ENSSSCG00000023779","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6B3"},"2029962":{"id":2029962,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019565","name":"SLC6A20","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Transporter ","uniprotId":"I3L6B4"},"2029963":{"id":2029963,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019566","name":"ENSSSCG00000017465","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6B5"},"2029964":{"id":2029964,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019567","name":"ENSSSCG00000021287","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6B6"},"2029965":{"id":2029965,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019570","name":"PSMD7","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6B9"},"2029966":{"id":2029966,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019571","name":"FAM73A","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6C0"},"2029967":{"id":2029967,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019572","name":"UBE2O","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6C1"},"2029968":{"id":2029968,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019573","name":"ENSSSCG00000023275","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6C2"},"2029969":{"id":2029969,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019574","name":"ENSSSCG00000024220","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3L6C3"},"2029970":{"id":2029970,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000019575","name":"AFGF","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Fibroblast growth factor 1 ; Plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival, cell division, angiogenesis, cell differentiation and cell migration.

During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of  [...] ","uniprotId":"P13618"},"2033497":{"id":2033497,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023529","name":"PLSCR3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHI3"},"2033498":{"id":2033498,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023530","name":"ENSSSCG00000021305","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase "},"2033499":{"id":2033499,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023531","name":"MRPL33","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHI5"},"2033500":{"id":2033500,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023532","name":"TNRC6B","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHI6"},"2033501":{"id":2033501,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023533","name":"ENSSSCG00000030698","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHI7"},"2033502":{"id":2033502,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023534","name":"ENSSSCG00000028253","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHI8"},"2033503":{"id":2033503,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023535","name":"ENSSSCG00000028621","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHI9"},"2033504":{"id":2033504,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023536","name":"IPO11","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHJ0"},"2033505":{"id":2033505,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023537","name":"SLBP2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHJ1"},"2033506":{"id":2033506,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023538","name":"ENSSSCG00000023220","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHJ2"},"2033507":{"id":2033507,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023539","name":"ENSSSCG00000026223","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHJ3"},"2033508":{"id":2033508,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023540","name":"PCDHGA10","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"I3LHJ4"},"2033509":{"id":2033509,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000023541","name":"GAD1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Glutamate decarboxylase 1 ;

Ligand binding induces a conformational change allowing subsequent or combinatorial  [...] ","uniprotId":"Q29040"},"2038181":{"id":2038181,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030836","name":"FMR1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"K7GSF4"},"2038182":{"id":2038182,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030840","name":"ATRX","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"K7GSF7"},"2038183":{"id":2038183,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030841","name":"SMAD5","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"K7GSF8"},"2038184":{"id":2038184,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030845","name":"ENSSSCG00000030876","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Annotation not available"},"2038185":{"id":2038185,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030846","name":"PPP1R18","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 18; May target protein phosphatase 1 to F-actin cytoskeleton","uniprotId":"Q767M0"},"2038186":{"id":2038186,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030847","name":"CHST7","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"F1RWY3"},"2038187":{"id":2038187,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030852","name":"CXCL17","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein ","uniprotId":"K7GSG9"},"2038188":{"id":2038188,"externalId":"9823.ENSSSCP00000030853","name":"AGTR1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Type-1 angiotensin II receptor ; Receptor for angiotensin II.
