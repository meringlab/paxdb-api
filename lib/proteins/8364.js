The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of E3 ligase complexes, leading to modify the Ubl ligase activity. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of nedd8 from cullins. It however has no metalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunits of the CSN complex; Belon [...] "},"3804449":{"id":3804449,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050273","name":"ENSXETG00000030250","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3804450":{"id":3804450,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050283","name":"sycp3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Synaptonemal complex protein 3"},"3804451":{"id":3804451,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050290","name":"ENSXETG00000023276","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3804452":{"id":3804452,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050295","name":"atoh1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Atonal bHLH transcription factor 1; Atonal homolog 1"},"3804453":{"id":3804453,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050298","name":"grid2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2"},"3804454":{"id":3804454,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050306","name":"hivep2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer binding protein 2"},"3804455":{"id":3804455,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050314","name":"cdc42ep2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CDC42 effector protein (Rho GTPase binding) 2"},"3804456":{"id":3804456,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050316","name":"pola2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"DNA polymerase alpha subunit B; May play an essential role at the early stage of chromosomal DNA replication by coupling the polymerase alpha/primase complex to the cellular replication machinery"},"3804457":{"id":3804457,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050320","name":"hsf2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Heat shock transcription factor 2"},"3804458":{"id":3804458,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050325","name":"serinc1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Serine incorporator 1"},"3804459":{"id":3804459,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000050330","name":"smpdl3a","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Belongs to the acid sphingomyelinase family.

Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling (By similarity)"},"3809109":{"id":3809109,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061887","name":"ezr","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Ezrin"},"3809110":{"id":3809110,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061888","name":"SUV420H2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Suppressor of variegation 4-20 homolog 2 (Drosophila)"},"3809111":{"id":3809111,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061889","name":"TP53BP1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Tumor protein p53 binding protein 1"},"3809112":{"id":3809112,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061891","name":"ENSXETG00000033510","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3809113":{"id":3809113,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061893","name":"IFITM5","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Interferon induced transmembrane protein 5"},"3809114":{"id":3809114,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061894","name":"GPR126","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"G protein-coupled receptor 126"},"3809115":{"id":3809115,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061895","name":"ifn2","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Type I interferon 2; Uncharacterized protein "},"3809116":{"id":3809116,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061896","name":"ENSXETG00000030033","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3809117":{"id":3809117,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061897","name":"c21orf33","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Chromosome 21 open reading frame 33"},"3809118":{"id":3809118,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061898","name":"ENSXETG00000033336","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3809119":{"id":3809119,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061902","name":"ppp1r2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 2 "},"3809120":{"id":3809120,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061905","name":"tmem65","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Transmembrane protein 65 "},"3809121":{"id":3809121,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061906","name":"wdr24","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"WD repeat domain 24 "},"3809122":{"id":3809122,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061908","name":"ENSXETG00000033630","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3809123":{"id":3809123,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000061910","name":"csf1r","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Receptor protein-tyrosine kinase; Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.

Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling"},"3810603":{"id":3810603,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063901","name":"ZNF513","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Zinc finger protein 513"},"3810604":{"id":3810604,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063902","name":"ENSXETG00000013605","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3810605":{"id":3810605,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063903","name":"ENSXETG00000031970","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3810606":{"id":3810606,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063904","name":"ENSXETG00000033744","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3810607":{"id":3810607,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063905","name":"ENSXETG00000033457","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3810608":{"id":3810608,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063906","name":"ENSXETG00000030561","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"3810609":{"id":3810609,"externalId":"8364.ENSXETP00000063909","name":"prmt3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Protein arginine methyltransferase 3; Belongs to the class I-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily.
