Its role in regulation differs depending on the neuron in which it is acting; thermosensation in AFD neurons, osmolality in ASH neur [...] ","uniprotId":"P34885"},"1030417":{"id":1030417,"externalId":"6239.F57G12.1.1","name":"F57G12.1","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein F57G12.1 ","uniprotId":"Q20955"},"1030418":{"id":1030418,"externalId":"6239.F57G12.2b","name":"F57G12.2","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"G5EEW2"},"1030419":{"id":1030419,"externalId":"6239.F57G4.1","name":"F57G4.1","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"Q9XUX6"},"1030420":{"id":1030420,"externalId":"6239.F57G4.10","name":"F57G4.10","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"D9N149"},"1030421":{"id":1030421,"externalId":"6239.F57G4.11","name":"F57G4.1","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"D9N150"},"1030422":{"id":1030422,"externalId":"6239.F57G4.8","name":"fbxa-192","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"F-box A protein family member (fbxa-192) ","uniprotId":"Q9XUX2"},"1030423":{"id":1030423,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.1","name":"srh-180","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine Receptor, class H family member (srh-180) ","uniprotId":"Q9XU91"},"1030424":{"id":1030424,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.3a","name":"srh-167","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine Receptor, class H family member (srh-167) ","uniprotId":"Q9XU90"},"1030425":{"id":1030425,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.4","name":"srw-87","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine Receptor, class W family member (srw-87) ","uniprotId":"Q9XU87"},"1030426":{"id":1030426,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.5","name":"F57G8.5","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Protein F57G8.5 ","uniprotId":"Q9XU88"},"1030427":{"id":1030427,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.6","name":"nhr-193","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Nuclear Hormone Receptor family member (nhr-193) ","uniprotId":"G5EC41"},"1030428":{"id":1030428,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.7","name":"F57G8.7","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein F57G8.7 ","uniprotId":"Q9XU92"},"1030429":{"id":1030429,"externalId":"6239.F57G8.8","name":"srv-36","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine Receptor, class V family member (srv-36) "},"1030430":{"id":1030430,"externalId":"6239.F57G9.1","name":"sre-31","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine receptor class epsilon-31 ","uniprotId":"O62266"},"1030431":{"id":1030431,"externalId":"6239.F57G9.2","name":"sre-30","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine receptor class epsilon-30 ","uniprotId":"O62267"},"1030432":{"id":1030432,"externalId":"6239.F57G9.3","name":"F57G9.3","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein F57G9.3 ","uniprotId":"O62268"},"1030433":{"id":1030433,"externalId":"6239.F57G9.4","name":"sre-29","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Serpentine receptor class epsilon-29 ","uniprotId":"O62269"},"1030434":{"id":1030434,"externalId":"6239.F57G9.7","name":"F57G9.7","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"G5EBZ3"},"1030435":{"id":1030435,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.1.2","name":"arf-3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"ADP-Ribosylation Factor related family member (arf-3) ","uniprotId":"G5EFK4"},"1030436":{"id":1030436,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.2","name":"unc-24","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"UNCoordinated family member (unc-24) ","uniprotId":"G5ED76"},"1030437":{"id":1030437,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.3","name":"ora-1","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Onchocerca Related Antigen family member (ora-1) ","uniprotId":"O45098"},"1030438":{"id":1030438,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.4","name":"frpr-10","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein F57H12.4 ","uniprotId":"O45096"},"1030439":{"id":1030439,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.5","name":"F57H12.5","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein F57H12.5 ","uniprotId":"O45095"},"1030440":{"id":1030440,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.6","name":"F57H12.6","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein F57H12.6 ","uniprotId":"O45097"},"1030441":{"id":1030441,"externalId":"6239.F57H12.7","name":"mec-17","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 ; Specifically acetylates 'Lys-40' in alpha-tubulin/mec-12 on the lumenal side of microtubules.

Transcriptional coactivator for crh-1, the homolog of vertebrate transcription factor CREB1 (PubMed:21331044). Regulates the transcription of metabolic genes and may have a role in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism (PubMed:25723162). Through crh-1, counteracts the pro-lifespan-extension signals of AMPK both cell autonomously and, when expressed in neurons, at a systemic level, possibly using the catecholamine analog, octopamine, as a messenger (PubMed:21331044, PubMed:25723162)","uniprotId":"Q95XA8"},"1036965":{"id":1036965,"externalId":"6239.Y20F4.3","name":"gap-3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"GTPase Activating Protein family member (gap-3) ","uniprotId":"Q95XA9"},"1036966":{"id":1036966,"externalId":"6239.Y20F4.4","name":"Y20F4.4","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y20F4.4 ","uniprotId":"Q95XA7"},"1036967":{"id":1036967,"externalId":"6239.Y20F4.5","name":"Y20F4.5","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Annotation not available"},"1036968":{"id":1036968,"externalId":"6239.Y20F4.8","name":"Y20F4.8","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"Q4W5M1"},"1036969":{"id":1036969,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.1","name":"Y22D7AL.1","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"Q965P3"},"1036970":{"id":1036970,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.10.1","name":"Y22D7AL.10","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.10 ","uniprotId":"Q965Q1"},"1036971":{"id":1036971,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.11","name":"Y22D7AL.11","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"Q965P8"},"1036972":{"id":1036972,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.12","name":"Y22D7AL.12","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"Q965P5"},"1036973":{"id":1036973,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.13","name":"Y22D7AL.13","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.13 ","uniprotId":"Q965P4"},"1036974":{"id":1036974,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.14","name":"cht-4","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.14 ","uniprotId":"Q965P2"},"1036975":{"id":1036975,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.15","name":"Y22D7AL.15","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.15 ","uniprotId":"Q965P1"},"1036976":{"id":1036976,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.16","name":"Y22D7AL.16","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.16 ","uniprotId":"Q965P0"},"1036977":{"id":1036977,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.2","name":"Y22D7AL.2","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Annotation not available"},"1036978":{"id":1036978,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.3","name":"Y22D7AL.3","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.3 ","uniprotId":"Q965P7"},"1036979":{"id":1036979,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.4","name":"Y22D7AL.4","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Protein Y22D7AL.4 ","uniprotId":"Q965P9"},"1036980":{"id":1036980,"externalId":"6239.Y22D7AL.5a.2","name":"hsp-60","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Chaperonin homolog Hsp-60, mitochondrial ; Implicated in mitochondrial protein import and macromolecular assembly.
