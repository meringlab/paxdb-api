Catalyzes the conversion of acetate into acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), an essential intermediate at the junction of anabolic and catabolic pathways. AcsA undergoes a two-step reaction. In the first half reaction, AcsA combines acetate with ATP to form acetyl-adenylate (AcAMP) intermediate. In the second half reaction, it can then transfer the acetyl group from AcAMP to the sulfhydryl group of CoA, forming the product AcCoA","uniprotId":"Q726Y7"},"6562":{"id":6562,"externalId":"882.DVU2970","name":"DVU_2970","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Acetyltransferase","uniprotId":"Q726Y6"},"6563":{"id":6563,"externalId":"882.DVU2971","name":"DVU_2971","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Glycosyl transferase family protein","uniprotId":"Q726Y5"},"6564":{"id":6564,"externalId":"882.DVU2972","name":"cheD","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Chemotaxis protein CheD; Probably deamidates glutamine residues to glutamate on methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors (MCPs), playing an important role in chemotaxis","uniprotId":"Q726Y4"},"6565":{"id":6565,"externalId":"882.DVU2973","name":"DVU_2973","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Integration host factor subunit beta","uniprotId":"Q726Y3"},"6566":{"id":6566,"externalId":"882.DVU2974","name":"DVU_2974","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Hypothetical protein","uniprotId":"Q726Y2"},"6567":{"id":6567,"externalId":"882.DVU2975","name":"DVU_2975","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Hydrolase","uniprotId":"Q726Y1"},"6568":{"id":6568,"externalId":"882.DVU2976","name":"DVU_2976","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Hypothetical protein","uniprotId":"Q726Y0"},"6569":{"id":6569,"externalId":"882.DVU2977","name":"DVU_2977","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Hypothetical protein","uniprotId":"Q726X9"},"6570":{"id":6570,"externalId":"882.DVU2978","name":"DVU_2978","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"HAD superfamily hydrolase","uniprotId":"Q726X8"},"6571":{"id":6571,"externalId":"882.DVU2979","name":"psd","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; Catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)","uniprotId":"Q726X7"},"6572":{"id":6572,"externalId":"882.DVU2980","name":"pssA","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CDP-diacylglycerol--serine O-phosphatidyltransferase","uniprotId":"Q726X6"},"6573":{"id":6573,"externalId":"882.DVU2981","name":"leuA","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"2-isopropylmalate synthase; Catalyzes the condensation of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate (2-oxoisovalerate) to form 3-carboxy-3-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate (2-isopropylmalate)","uniprotId":"Q726X5"},"6574":{"id":6574,"externalId":"882.DVU2982","name":"leuC","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit; Catalyzes the isomerization between 2-isopropylmalate and 3-isopropylmalate, via the formation of 2-isopropylmaleate","uniprotId":"Q726X4"},"6575":{"id":6575,"externalId":"882.DVU2983","name":"leuD","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"3-isopropylmalate dehydratase small subunit; Catalyzes the isomerization between 2-isopropylmalate and 3-isopropylmalate, via the formation of 2-isopropylmaleate","uniprotId":"Q726X3"},"6576":{"id":6576,"externalId":"882.DVU2984","name":"DVU_2984","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Hypothetical protein","uniprotId":"Q726X2"},"6577":{"id":6577,"externalId":"882.DVU2985","name":"leuB","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase; Catalyzes the oxidation of 3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-4- methylpentanoate (3-isopropylmalate) to 3-carboxy-4-methyl-2- oxopentanoate.
