During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following t [...] ","uniprotId":"A0A117DYL3_ASPNG"},"1977712":{"id":1977712,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005448","name":"An07g02870","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cortical protein marker for cell polarity family protein; Function: Rax2 of S. cerevisiae functions as a marker","uniprotId":"A0A124BWL8_ASPNG"},"1977713":{"id":1977713,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005449","name":"An07g02880","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Fungal specific transcription factor domain family protein; Similarity to hypothetical protein EAA57627.1 - Aspergillus nidulans","uniprotId":"A0A100IED1_ASPNG"},"1977714":{"id":1977714,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005450","name":"CADANGAP00005450","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase N-terminal domain family protein; Putative uncharacterized protein An07g02890"},"1977715":{"id":1977715,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005451","name":"CADANGAP00005451","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"RNA recognition motif family protein; Putative uncharacterized protein An07g02900","uniprotId":"A0A100IEB4_ASPNG"},"1977716":{"id":1977716,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005452","name":"CADANGAP00005452","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"1977717":{"id":1977717,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005453","name":"CADANGAP00005453","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"1977718":{"id":1977718,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005454","name":"CADANGAP00005454","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"1977719":{"id":1977719,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005455","name":"CADANGAP00005455","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An07g02940"},"1977720":{"id":1977720,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005456","name":"CADANGAP00005456","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"1977721":{"id":1977721,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005457","name":"An07g02960","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Ribosomal S13/S15 N-terminal domain family protein; Putative uncharacterized protein An07g02960; Belongs to the universal ribosomal protein uS15 family","uniprotId":"A0A100IF42_ASPNG"},"1977722":{"id":1977722,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005458","name":"An07g02970","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"VRR-NUC domain family protein; Remark: the translated sequence of the ORF probably contains some introns","uniprotId":"A0A124BWM5_ASPNG"},"1977723":{"id":1977723,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005459","name":"CADANGAP00005459","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Dpy-30 motif family protein; Putative uncharacterized protein An07g02980"},"1977724":{"id":1977724,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005460","name":"An07g02990","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"RNA recognition motif family protein; Function: AUF1 of H. sapiens is a component of the ribonucleosomes","uniprotId":"A0A100IEC9_ASPNG"},"1977725":{"id":1977725,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005461","name":"An07g03000","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Enhancer of polycomb-like family protein; Function: BR140 of H. sapiens is a probable transcription regulator","uniprotId":"A0A100IEA9_ASPNG"},"1977726":{"id":1977726,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005462","name":"CADANGAP00005462","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"1977727":{"id":1977727,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005463","name":"CADANGAP00005463","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Function: O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase is a neutral metalloprotease"},"1977728":{"id":1977728,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00005464","name":"An07g03030","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in mitochondrial tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine.
