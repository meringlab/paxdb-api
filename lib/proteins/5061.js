After interaction with mocs2b, the sulfur is then transferred to precursor Z to form molybdopterin (By similarity)"},"696339":{"id":696339,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009384","name":"An12g01130","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696340":{"id":696340,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009385","name":"An12g01140","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01140"},"696341":{"id":696341,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009386","name":"An12g01150","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01150"},"696342":{"id":696342,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009387","name":"An12g01160","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696343":{"id":696343,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009388","name":"An12g01170","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Function: MatB is part of a three gene cluster"},"696344":{"id":696344,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009389","name":"An12g01180","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01180"},"696345":{"id":696345,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009390","name":"An12g01190","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Function: SSO1 and SSO2 of yeast encode syntaxin homologs"},"696346":{"id":696346,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009391","name":"An12g01200","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696347":{"id":696347,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009392","name":"An12g01210","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Function: PTR2 of S. cerevisiae facilitates the uptake of small peptides"},"696348":{"id":696348,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009393","name":"An12g01220","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Title: questionable ORF"},"696349":{"id":696349,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009394","name":"An12g01230","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696350":{"id":696350,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009395","name":"An12g01250","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01250"},"696351":{"id":696351,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009396","name":"An12g01260","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Catalytic activity: Nitrile + H2O = Carboxylate + NH3"},"696352":{"id":696352,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009397","name":"An12g01270","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01270"},"696353":{"id":696353,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009398","name":"An12g01280","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01280"},"696354":{"id":696354,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009399","name":"An12g01290","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696355":{"id":696355,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009400","name":"An12g01300","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Function: in N. crassa"},"696356":{"id":696356,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009401","name":"An12g01310","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Similarity: ORF is also similar to hypothetical peptidoglycan binding domain protein"},"696357":{"id":696357,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009402","name":"An12g01320","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Function: Linoleate diol synthase is a homotetrameric ferric hemeprotein"},"696358":{"id":696358,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009403","name":"An12g01330","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Remark: The eIF4E gene of S. pombe encodes the cap-binding component eIF4E"},"696359":{"id":696359,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009404","name":"An12g01340","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01340"},"696360":{"id":696360,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009405","name":"An12g01350","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01350"},"696361":{"id":696361,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009406","name":"An12g01360","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cofactor: Heme"},"696362":{"id":696362,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009407","name":"An12g01370","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Similarity: Most weak blast hits are caused by repetetive sequence elements"},"696363":{"id":696363,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009408","name":"An12g01380","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Cofactor: NADPH"},"696364":{"id":696364,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009409","name":"An12g01400","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696365":{"id":696365,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009410","name":"An12g01410","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Title: questionable ORF"},"696366":{"id":696366,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009411","name":"An12g01420","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein An12g01420"},"696367":{"id":696367,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009412","name":"An12g01430","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Putative uncharacterized protein"},"696368":{"id":696368,"externalId":"5061.CADANGAP00009413","name":"An12g01440","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Similarity to hypothetical cation efflux system protein czcB3 -
