Homotetrameric channels mediate a delayed-rectifier voltage-dependent outward potassium current that display rapid activation and slow inactivation in response to membrane depolarization (PubMed: [...] ","uniprotId":"Q95167"},"1879064":{"id":1879064,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000032918","name":"cOR8U2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"cOR8U2 olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily U-like","uniprotId":"F1PPA7"},"1879065":{"id":1879065,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000032923","name":"ELSPBP1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Epididymal sperm-binding protein 1 ; Binds to spermatozoa upon ejaculation and may play a role in sperm capacitation.
