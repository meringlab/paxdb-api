Most of frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK-3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase.

As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprot"},"53577312":{"id":53577312,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006892","name":"RAB30","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"RAB30, member RAS oncogene family"},"53577313":{"id":53577313,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006895","name":"HPDL","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase"},"53577314":{"id":53577314,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006896","name":"GRIN2C","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2C"},"53577315":{"id":53577315,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006902","name":"TOMM40","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40"},"53577316":{"id":53577316,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006905","name":"NECTIN2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Nectin cell adhesion molecule 2"},"53577317":{"id":53577317,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006907","name":"PLXND1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Plexin D1"},"53577318":{"id":53577318,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006909","name":"MAPRE3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Microtubule associated protein RP/EB family member 3"},"53577319":{"id":53577319,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006910","name":"H1-8","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"H15 domain-containing protein"},"53577320":{"id":53577320,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006911","name":"PRCP","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Prolylcarboxypeptidase"},"53577321":{"id":53577321,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006917","name":"FDXR","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"NADPH:adrenodoxin oxidoreductase, mitochondrial"},"53577322":{"id":53577322,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006920","name":"CRTAP","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cartilage associated protein"},"53577323":{"id":53577323,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006923","name":"CBLC","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cbl proto-oncogene C"},"53577324":{"id":53577324,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006924","name":"FADS6","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Fatty acid desaturase 6"},"53577325":{"id":53577325,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006928","name":"TMEM214","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Transmembrane protein 214"},"53577326":{"id":53577326,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006932","name":"BCL3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"BCL3 transcription coactivator"},"53577327":{"id":53577327,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006935","name":"CCR4","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"C-C chemokine receptor type 4; High affinity receptor for the C-C type chemokines CCL17/TARC and CCL22/MDC.
