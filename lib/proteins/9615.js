As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprot","uniprotId":"APOE_CANLF"},"53577312":{"id":53577312,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006892","name":"RAB30","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"RAB30, member RAS oncogene family","uniprotId":"E2RG98_CANLF"},"53577313":{"id":53577313,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006895","name":"HPDL","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase","uniprotId":"E2RG97_CANLF"},"53577314":{"id":53577314,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006896","name":"GRIN2C","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2C","uniprotId":"E2RG96_CANLF"},"53577315":{"id":53577315,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006902","name":"TOMM40","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40","uniprotId":"F1PWL7_CANLF"},"53577316":{"id":53577316,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006905","name":"NECTIN2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Nectin cell adhesion molecule 2","uniprotId":"F1PWL4_CANLF"},"53577317":{"id":53577317,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006907","name":"PLXND1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Plexin D1","uniprotId":"E2RDE1_CANLF"},"53577318":{"id":53577318,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006909","name":"MAPRE3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Microtubule associated protein RP/EB family member 3","uniprotId":"E2RDE0_CANLF"},"53577319":{"id":53577319,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006910","name":"H1-8","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"H15 domain-containing protein","uniprotId":"E2RDD0_CANLF"},"53577320":{"id":53577320,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006911","name":"PRCP","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Prolylcarboxypeptidase","uniprotId":"F1PWK3_CANLF"},"53577321":{"id":53577321,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006917","name":"FDXR","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"NADPH:adrenodoxin oxidoreductase, mitochondrial","uniprotId":"E2RDC3_CANLF"},"53577322":{"id":53577322,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006920","name":"CRTAP","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cartilage associated protein","uniprotId":"E2RCK3_CANLF"},"53577323":{"id":53577323,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006923","name":"CBLC","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cbl proto-oncogene C","uniprotId":"E2RCK0_CANLF"},"53577324":{"id":53577324,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006924","name":"FADS6","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Fatty acid desaturase 6","uniprotId":"F1PWI3_CANLF"},"53577325":{"id":53577325,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006928","name":"TMEM214","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Transmembrane protein 214","uniprotId":"E2RCJ3_CANLF"},"53577326":{"id":53577326,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006932","name":"BCL3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"BCL3 transcription coactivator","uniprotId":"E2RCH7_CANLF"},"53577327":{"id":53577327,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000006935","name":"CCR4","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"C-C chemokine receptor type 4; High affinity receptor for the C-C type chemokines CCL17/TARC and CCL22/MDC.

The transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA is a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates to a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates both histones H2A and H2B. The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators such as MYC, where it is required for transcription","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BTJ4_CANLF"},"53589255":{"id":53589255,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045179","name":"ENSCAFP00000045179","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Vomeronasal type-1 receptor","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BTK0_CANLF"},"53589256":{"id":53589256,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045181","name":"PMEL","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Premelanosome protein","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BTL6_CANLF"},"53589257":{"id":53589257,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045193","name":"ENSCAFP00000045193","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BWG6_CANLF"},"53589258":{"id":53589258,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045194","name":"LIAS","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Lipoyl synthase, mitochondrial; Catalyzes the radical-mediated insertion of two sulfur atoms into the C-6 and C-8 positions of the octanoyl moiety bound to the lipoyl domains of lipoate-dependent enzymes, thereby converting the octanoylated domains into lipoylated derivatives.","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BTL5_CANLF"},"53589259":{"id":53589259,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045199","name":"ENSCAFP00000045199","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Reverse transcriptase domain-containing protein","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BTL7_CANLF"},"53589260":{"id":53589260,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045202","name":"TEX36","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Testis expressed 36","uniprotId":"A0A5F4BTP6_CANLF"},"53589261":{"id":53589261,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045203","name":"CYP7B1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1; Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.

Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components involved both in vesicle formation and cargo selection. They control the vesicular transport of proteins in different trafficking pathways. AP-4 forms a non clathrin- associated coat on vesicles departing the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and may be involved in the targeting of proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal-lysosomal system (By similarity). It is also involved in protein sorting to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells and the pro","uniprotId":"AP4M1_CANLF"},"53589422":{"id":53589422,"externalId":"9615.ENSCAFP00000045742","name":"CHN1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Chimaerin; GTPase-activating protein for p21-rac.
