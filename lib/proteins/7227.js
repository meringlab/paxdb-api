Inhibits Egfr signaling without interacting directly with the receptor, but instead by sequestering the Egfr-activating ligand spitz (spi)","uniprotId":"GIL_DROME"},"1254229":{"id":1254229,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0075167","name":"dsx-c73A","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"doublesex cognate 73A","uniprotId":"Q9VV62_DROME"},"1254230":{"id":1254230,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0075168","name":"Aats-tyr","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase","uniprotId":"Q9VV60_DROME"},"1254231":{"id":1254231,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0075169","name":"CG4573","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG4573 gene product from transcript CG4573-RA (EC:6.1.1.17)","uniprotId":"B5RJ44_DROME"},"1254232":{"id":1254232,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0075170","name":"fax","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"failed axon connections;

DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling"},"1259322":{"id":1259322,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0085250","name":"FBpp0085250","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"His3:CG31613"},"1259323":{"id":1259323,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0085251","name":"Lamp1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Lamp1","uniprotId":"C0PUW8_DROME"},"1259324":{"id":1259324,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0085252","name":"Ac3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Ac3","uniprotId":"O96306_DROME"},"1259325":{"id":1259325,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0085254","name":"Cul-2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cullin-2","uniprotId":"Q9V9R2_DROME"},"1259326":{"id":1259326,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0085258","name":"CG1416","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG1416 gene product from transcript CG1416-RA","uniprotId":"E8NH58_DROME"},"1259327":{"id":1259327,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0085261","name":"tsh","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"teashirt; Homeotic protein that acts downstream of Arm in the Wg cascade during embryogenesis to determine segment identity throughout the entire trunk.

The components function by regulating the cortical actin and thereby stabilizing the extended morphology of the surface glia, which in turn is necessary for [...] ","uniprotId":"MOODY_DROME"},"1263262":{"id":1263262,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292193","name":"CG42726","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG42726 gene product from transcript CG42726-RA","uniprotId":"C1C3H3_DROME"},"1263263":{"id":1263263,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292194","name":"CG42727","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG42727 gene product from transcript CG42727-RA"},"1263264":{"id":1263264,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292195","name":"CG42728","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG42728 gene product from transcript CG42728-RA","uniprotId":"B3DNG6_DROME"},"1263265":{"id":1263265,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292196","name":"CG42729","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG42729 gene product from transcript CG42729-RA","uniprotId":"G2J5U4_DROME"},"1263266":{"id":1263266,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292197","name":"CG42730","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG42730 gene product from transcript CG42730-RA"},"1263267":{"id":1263267,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292198","name":"tectonic","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"tectonic","uniprotId":"TECT_DROME"},"1263268":{"id":1263268,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292199","name":"CG42732","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG42732 gene product from transcript CG42732-RN","uniprotId":"A8DY93_DROME"},"1263269":{"id":1263269,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292205","name":"CG42733","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG42733 gene product from transcript CG42733-RD","uniprotId":"A1Z880_DROME"},"1263270":{"id":1263270,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292213","name":"CG10858","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG10858 gene product from transcript CG10858-RB","uniprotId":"Q9VZN1_DROME"},"1263271":{"id":1263271,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292214","name":"Cad99C","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Cad99C","uniprotId":"Q4L2X0_DROME"},"1263272":{"id":1263272,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292221","name":"CG7991","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG7991 gene product from transcript CG7991-RB","uniprotId":"C5WLT9_DROME"},"1263273":{"id":1263273,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292225","name":"Dhc62B","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Dynein heavy chain at 62B","uniprotId":"Q7KVA7_DROME"},"1263274":{"id":1263274,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292226","name":"CG7971","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG7971 gene product from transcript CG7971-RC","uniprotId":"A8JNI2_DROME"},"1263275":{"id":1263275,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292244","name":"Ank2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Ankyrin 2","uniprotId":"A8JNM4_DROME"},"1263276":{"id":1263276,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0292247","name":"Ptp99A","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 99A; May play a key role in signal transduction and growth control.

Most of frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK- 3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase.

Catalytic subunit of the Esc/E(z) complex, which methylates 'Lys-9' and 'Lys-27' of histone H3, leading to transcriptional repression of the affected target gene. While PcG proteins are generally required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development, this protein is specifically required during the first 6 hours of embryogenesis to establish the repressed state. The Esc/E(z) complex is necessary but not sufficient for the repression of homeotic target genes, suggesting that the recruitment o [...] ","uniprotId":"EZ_DROME"},"1265552":{"id":1265552,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306193","name":"CG13875","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG13875 gene product from transcript CG13875-RB","uniprotId":"Q8MRB6_DROME"},"1265553":{"id":1265553,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306201","name":"CG18173","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG18173 gene product from transcript CG18173-RB (EC:2.3.-.-)","uniprotId":"Q9W096_DROME"},"1265554":{"id":1265554,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306204","name":"drpr","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"draper","uniprotId":"Q1EC80_DROME"},"1265555":{"id":1265555,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306206","name":"CG13931","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG13931 gene product from transcript CG13931-RB","uniprotId":"Q4V4Q7_DROME"},"1265556":{"id":1265556,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306207","name":"gdl","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"gonadal","uniprotId":"GDL_DROME"},"1265557":{"id":1265557,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306210","name":"CG7841","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG7841 gene product from transcript CG7841-RB","uniprotId":"Q9VUP0_DROME"},"1265558":{"id":1265558,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306211","name":"CG12355","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG12355 gene product from transcript CG12355-RD","uniprotId":"A8JNT1_DROME"},"1265559":{"id":1265559,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306213","name":"CG14562","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"CG14562 gene product from transcript CG14562-RB","uniprotId":"Q8MZ59_DROME"},"1265560":{"id":1265560,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306214","name":"CS-2","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Chitin synthase 2","uniprotId":"B7Z099_DROME"},"1265561":{"id":1265561,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306223","name":"Gem3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Gemin3","uniprotId":"Q9V3C4_DROME"},"1265562":{"id":1265562,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306226","name":"CG43991","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG43991 gene product from transcript CG43991-RA"},"1265563":{"id":1265563,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306228","name":"CG43993","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG43993 gene product from transcript CG43993-RA"},"1265564":{"id":1265564,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306231","name":"CG14561","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"CG14561 gene product from transcript CG14561-RB","uniprotId":"Q9VNW2_DROME"},"1265565":{"id":1265565,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306232","name":"RpLP0","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Ribosomal protein LP0; Ribosomal protein P0 is the functional equivalent of E.coli protein L10","uniprotId":"RLA0_DROME"},"1265566":{"id":1265566,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0306233","name":"msopa","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"male-specific opa containing gene; May be a male specific regulatory factor","uniprotId":"OPAP_DROME"}};
