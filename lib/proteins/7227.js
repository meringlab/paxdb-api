After interaction with MOCS2B, the sulfur is then transferred to precursor Z to form molybdopterin","uniprotId":"P0C919"},"1262609":{"id":1262609,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289863","name":"CG42505","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"GH04404p3 ","uniprotId":"E1JIJ1"},"1262610":{"id":1262610,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289864","name":"CG42504","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"GH04404p2 ","uniprotId":"E1JIJ2"},"1262611":{"id":1262611,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289866","name":"CG42507","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein, isoform A ","uniprotId":"E1JI01"},"1262612":{"id":1262612,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289871","name":"CG42511","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"GH05505p1 ","uniprotId":"E1JIG6"},"1262613":{"id":1262613,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289876","name":"CG42512","hasFamily":false,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein, isoform A ","uniprotId":"E1JJL6"},"1262614":{"id":1262614,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289879","name":"CG42514","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Adenylate cyclase activity","uniprotId":"Q0E8E1"},"1262615":{"id":1262615,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289882","name":"Pbp49","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"PSEA-binding protein 49kD","uniprotId":"Q7JUY8"},"1262616":{"id":1262616,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289884","name":"CG42516","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"LD18062p1 ","uniprotId":"E1JH07"},"1262617":{"id":1262617,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289887","name":"CG42518","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein, isoform A ","uniprotId":"E1JGK8"},"1262618":{"id":1262618,"externalId":"7227.FBpp0289888","name":"MED9","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Mediator complex subunit 9; Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes.
