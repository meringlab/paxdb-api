Targets antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and monocytes and inhibits their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including granuloc [...] "},"4394550":{"id":4394550,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003210","name":"IL19","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interleukin 19"},"4394551":{"id":4394551,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003212","name":"IL20","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interleukin 20"},"4394552":{"id":4394552,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003213","name":"IL24","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interleukin 24"},"4394553":{"id":4394553,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003216","name":"FAIM3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 3"},"4394554":{"id":4394554,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003221","name":"FCAMR","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Fc receptor, IgA, IgM, high affinity"},"4394555":{"id":4394555,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003222","name":"C1orf116","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Chromosome 1 open reading frame 116"},"4394556":{"id":4394556,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003224","name":"YOD1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; YOD1 OTU deubiquinating enzyme 1 homolog "},"4394557":{"id":4394557,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003226","name":"PFKFB2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-biphosphatase 2; Uncharacterized protein "},"4394558":{"id":4394558,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003228","name":"C4BPA","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Complement component 4 binding protein, alpha"},"4394559":{"id":4394559,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003238","name":"CR2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Complement component (3d/Epstein Barr virus) receptor 2"},"4394560":{"id":4394560,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003245","name":"LOC469660","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Pan troglodytes complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (Knops blood group) (CR1), mRNA"},"4394561":{"id":4394561,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003252","name":"CD46","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"4394562":{"id":4394562,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003262","name":"CD34","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; CD34 molecule"},"4394563":{"id":4394563,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003263","name":"PLXNA2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"4394564":{"id":4394564,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003266","name":"CAMK1G","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IG; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily"},"4394565":{"id":4394565,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003269","name":"G0S2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"G0/G1 switch protein 2; Promotes apoptosis by binding to BCL2, hence preventing the formation of protective BCL2-BAX heterodimers"},"4394566":{"id":4394566,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003270","name":"HSD11B1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 1; Uncharacterized protein "},"4394567":{"id":4394567,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003272","name":"TRAF3IP3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"TRAF3 interacting protein 3"},"4394568":{"id":4394568,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003273","name":"C1H1orf74","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Chromosome 1 open reading frame 74; Uncharacterized protein "},"4394569":{"id":4394569,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003274","name":"IRF6","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interferon regulatory factor 6"},"4394570":{"id":4394570,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003276","name":"SYT14","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Synaptotagmin XIV"},"4394571":{"id":4394571,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003278","name":"SERTAD4","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"SERTA domain containing 4"},"4394572":{"id":4394572,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003280","name":"HHAT","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Hedgehog acyltransferase; Uncharacterized protein ; Belongs to the membrane-bound acyltransferase family"},"4394573":{"id":4394573,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003283","name":"KCNH1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily H (eag-related), member 1"},"4394574":{"id":4394574,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003285","name":"RCOR3","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein"},"4394575":{"id":4394575,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000003288","name":"TRAF5","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Belongs to the TNF receptor-associated factor family.

Thereby, it participates to the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursor [...] "},"4405313":{"id":4405313,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035597","name":"IFNB1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interferon, beta 1, fibroblast"},"4405314":{"id":4405314,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035598","name":"IFNW1","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Interferon, omega 1"},"4405315":{"id":4405315,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035599","name":"IFNA21","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Interferon, alpha 21"},"4405316":{"id":4405316,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035604","name":"IFNA6","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interferon, alpha 6"},"4405317":{"id":4405317,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035606","name":"IFNA2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Interferon, alpha 2"},"4405318":{"id":4405318,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035607","name":"IFNA5","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Uncharacterized protein; Interferon, alpha 5"},"4405319":{"id":4405319,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035609","name":"IFNE","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Interferon, epsilon; Uncharacterized protein "},"4405320":{"id":4405320,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035612","name":"MTAP","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase; Catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of S-methyl-5'- thioadenosine (MTA) to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate.
