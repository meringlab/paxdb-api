Binding of RISC to a perfectly complementary mRNA generally results in silencing due to endonucleolytic cleavage of the  [...] ","uniprotId":"H2QWS0_PANTR"},"4405210":{"id":4405210,"externalId":"9598.ENSPTRP00000035264","name":"PTK2","hasFamily":true,"annotation":"Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.
